This book was typeset using \LaTeX{} with the \texttt{book} document
class on A4~paper.  Body text is set in Latin Modern Roman at 12\,pt.
Code listings use Latin Modern Mono via the \texttt{listings} package.
Diagrams were drawn with Ti\textit{k}Z.  Charts and data visualisations
in the dashboard chapters were produced with Recharts (React) and
reproduced here as referenced screenshots.

The bibliography was managed with Bib\LaTeX{} and the Biber backend,
using the IEEE citation style.

The source code of both the book and the system it documents resides in
a single Git repository, ensuring that the documentation always
corresponds to an identifiable version of the software.
