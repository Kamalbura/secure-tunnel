MAV_TO_MAV_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt

1. FINAL MENTAL MODEL
---------------------
The system is a LIVE MAVLink Control Channel.
- Source: Physical Pixhawk (Drone) / QGC (GCS).
- Transport: PQC Secure Tunnel (UDP).
- Components: `sdrone_bench.py` (Controller) <-> `sgcs_bench.py` (Follower).
- Traffic: Real telemetry/commands ONLY. No synthetic load.

2. VERIFIED INVARIANTS
----------------------
[x] MAVProxy starts ONCE per side (Verified in `_bench.py` logic, `ManagedProcess` usage).
[x] MAVProxy MUST NOT restart between suites (Logic check: `start_mavproxy` called once in `run()`, not in loop).
[x] MAVProxy MUST be killed when scheduler exits (Enforced via `ManagedProcess` in `sgcs_bench.py` and `sdrone_bench.py`).
[x] NO SYNTHETIC TRAFFIC (Enforced via code removal/neutralization).
[x] Git State: Baseline `e7cfde` + Fixes.

3. FIXED BUGS
-------------
- **Orphan Risk**: `sgcs_bench.py` GCS MAVProxy now uses `ManagedProcess` (Windows Job Object linked).
- **Traffic Noise**: `UdpTrafficGenerator` fully neutralized. `start_traffic` RPCs are no-ops.
- **Hardcoded Paths**: Replaced `chronos_v2_run_20260202_clean` with dynamic timestamped logs.

4. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
--------------------
- **Throughput Metrics**: Reports might show "0 Mbps" or "Low" if MAVLink telemetry is silent (e.g., Pixhawk disarmed/sleeping). This is NOT a failure, but the report parser must be aware.
- **Packet Loss**: Real UDP loss is possible; no retransmission in the tunnel (it's UDP). MAVLink handles reliability.

5. GIT COMMIT STATE
-------------------
- Base: `e7cfde009ed3fe786dc50bf0e506688702f08f62`
- Applied Corrections:
    - Neutralized traffic generators in `sscheduler/`.
    - Switched GCS MAVProxy to `ManagedProcess`.
    - Dynamic log paths.
    - Verified `core/config.py` matches Deployment Facts (192.168.0.x).

6. FINAL VERDICT
----------------
**SAFE for live Pixhawk↔GCS runs.**

The code now respects the "Live" constraint, manages processes safely, and will not inject noise into the control channel.
